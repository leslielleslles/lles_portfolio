### Identifying Age-Related Conditions
- Employed various machine learning models, including random forests and feedforward neural networks via TensorFlow's Sequential API, to predict the likelihood of individuals having age-related medical conditions using a Kaggle dataset. Performed data wrangling and preprocessing using sklearn's StandardScaler, PCA and KNNImputer, as well as addressed imbalanced dataset and potential bias in the features.
